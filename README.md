## Hello there!
Welcome to the AALAN Github Repo, where you can read all the specs for aalan.
Here you can find the grammar for the language and a bunch of examples.

## Compiling
If you'd like to compile the language, check out the compilers we make ([c++](https://github.com/AAL-org/AALCPP), [c](https://github.com/AAL-org/aalc)), or feel free to try write one yourself.

## About
AALAN or just AAL for short is a small language project. We're trying to create a decently functional language, however awful it may be.
Don't expect it to be fast, or to really work at all.
